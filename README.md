My first prototype is a 2D RPG that uses basic camera and character control mechanics with added attributes of animation and sprite design. The controls are simple arrows with space for jump, with animations for each movement. The assets were obtained from Unity Shop. Additionally, this prototype uses physics components such as map colliders, composite colliders, box and circle coliders to create an atmosphere that players are familar with in 2D side scroller games. Inspiration was drawn from popular web games such as Fireboy and Watergirl and other 2D dynamic environments where collectables must be gathered in x amount of time while avoiding trigger objects such as spikes, wells, cliffs, and eventually lava and zombies in later levels. 
I hope to use the elemental tetrad theory in my design that specifies aesthetics as being the most important. While the mechanics, and technology are simple and straight forward, I hope that this game will allow players to relive their childhood memories of playing silly 2D games again.

Additionally, you can find demos for Apple Picker and Mission Demolition in the menu screen.
